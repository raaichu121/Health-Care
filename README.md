## 🛠️ Technologies Under the Hood 🛠️

This project is built upon a robust and modern technology stack, chosen for its efficiency, scalability, and developer experience:

* **React.js (v18.x):** The foundational JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces. React's declarative nature and virtual DOM enable efficient updates and a highly interactive user experience.
* **React Router DOM (v6.x):** Utilized for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different views without full page reloads. This provides a single-page application (SPA) experience, enhancing performance and user flow.
* **CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (if applicable, otherwise standard CSS):** For styling the application. (Based on the `App.css` import, this project likely uses standard CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and customizable aesthetic.)
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The primary programming language for all application logic, leveraging modern features for cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.
* **Node.js & npm:** Used as the runtime environment and package manager for building, running, and managing project dependencies.

🗺️ Detailed Navigation Map 🗺️

The application's routing is meticulously defined using react-router-dom to ensure a logical and intuitive user flow:

    /: This route renders the Home component. It serves as the primary entry point and provides an overview of the application's services and features.

    /legal: This route renders the Legal component. It's dedicated to displaying legal disclaimers, privacy policies, terms of service, and other important compliance information.

    /appointment: This route renders the Appointment component. It's the central hub for all appointment-related functionalities, including scheduling, viewing, and managing existing bookings.

    * (wildcard route): This catch-all route renders the NotFound component. It's activated when a user attempts to navigate to a URL that does not match any defined routes, providing a graceful fallback.
